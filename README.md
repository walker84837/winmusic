# music_bot

> A simple and configurable music Discord bot.

A simple and work-in-progress Discord bot written in Rust. The code may not compile as I'm not familiar with making Discord bots in Rust, especially music bots. I will come up with a name for it once it works once configured correctly (.env and config file).

If you know Rust or are familiar with [poise](https://crates.io/crates/poise) and/or [songbird](https://crates.io/crates/songbird), feel free to contribute!
